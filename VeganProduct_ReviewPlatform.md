# Problem
People that want to transition to a vegan/vegetarian diet often want to eat meat replacements that still taste like the original product. By now there are many alternatives on the market but the customer does not know which product tastes good and where to buy it. 

# Solution
A platform on which consumers can rate vegan/vegetarian food and write comments about it. A system similar to Amazon reviews but also including information in which local stores the product can be bought (for which price). 

The user journey that I imagine is someone standing in a supermarket, scanning the barcode of a product with their smartphone and instantly seeing how the product is rated and how other customers use it. 

# MVP
* webapp that stores name, image and EAN number of a given product and allows users to rate it on a scale of 1-5.
* in later stages, commenting, price and location information can be added as functionalities

# Customers
* Conscious consumers
* Maybe also supermarkets and producers of vegan food

# Revenue model
* advertising and affiliate links to vegan online stores

# Pros
* Rather easy to maintain once built
* Little money required to start and run the project

# Cons
* hard to monetize
