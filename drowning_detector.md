# Problem
Lifeguards can not observe every swimmer at all times. Sometimes drowning is detected too late or not at all.

# Solution
A fixed camera system installed on the beach or on the sealing of a public pool that feeds its data into a neural net. Whenever high likelyhood of drowning is detected, the lifeguard is alarmed and shown the seconds prior to the event on a screen so that he can decide if it really is a drowning situation.

# MVP
* Fixed installation in public pool that is only an addition to a human lifeguard
* learnings from this prototype can be used to build system for less stable environments like outdoor beaches

# Customers
* public pools and beach administrations
* eventually private pools possible as well

# Revenue model
* sales of hardware & installation
* subscription to software

# Pros
* great project that can literally save lives
* large market

# Cons
* lives are in danger if system does not work
* hard to enter the market
